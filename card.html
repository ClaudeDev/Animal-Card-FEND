        A black panther is the melanistic color variant of any big cat species. Black panthers in Asia and Africa are leopards (Panthera pardus), and those in the Americas are black jaguars (Panthera onca). Panthers are great swimmers and often dive to relax
        themselves. They have keen sense of hearing and extremely good eye sight with strong jaws and firm claws to hold on their prey. They are very agile and can leap up to 20 feet to catch their food. They are very good and strong climbers and can
        take their heavy prey on trees and devour the food there.
